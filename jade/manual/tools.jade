p
  | The tool table keeps track of the tools used to cut the workpiece.
  | These tools are indexed by numbers starting from 1.  You can add remove
  | and change the parameters of the tools in the tool table.  Rerun the
  | simulation to see the effect of your changes.
p
  | Any tools referenced by the tool path which are not in the tool table
  | will be automatically created by the simulator.  The default tool is
  | probably not what you want so you should add the tools you need,
  | edit their parameters and rerun the simulation.

h2#tools-add-remove Adding & Removing
p
  | New tools can be added either via the <tt>Project</tt> menu or by right
  | clicking on the <tt>Project</tt> dock and select <tt>Add Tool</tt>.
p
  | To remove a tool right click on the tool and select <tt>Remove Tool</tt>.

h2#tool-view Tool View

p
  | The <tt>Tool View</tt> shows a diagram of the currently selected tool.
  | It automatically updates as you change tool parameters.  Note, that the
  | view automatically zooms to fit the tool so increasing tool length may
  | appear to shrink the tool's diameter but it is only the relative
  | diameter that is shrinking.

h2#tools-order Changing Tool Order
p
  | Tools are always sorted in numerical order.  You can change a tool's order
  | by changing it's number.  The user interface will not allow you to create
  | two tools with the same number.  Make sure all of the tools referenced
  | by your tool paths are defined in the tool table.

h2#tools-description Description
p
  | CAMotics will give each tool a default description based on it's shape
  | and diameter.  You can change this by editing the <tt>Description</tt>
  | field.

h2#tools-units Units
p
  | Tools can be specified in either millimeters or inches regardless of the
  | <a href='#projects-units'>project units</a> setting.

h2#tools-shape Shape
p
  | CAMotics support the following tool shapes:
  ul
    li Cylinderical
    li Conical
    li Ballnose
    li Spheroid
    li Snubnose

h2#tools-dimensions Dimensions
p
  | Tool <tt>Length</tt> and <tt>Diameter</tt> can be set.  These specify the
  | cutting area only and do not include the tool shaft.  Snubnose tools have an
  | additional parameter <tt>Snub Diameter</tt>.
