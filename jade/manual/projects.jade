  h1#projects Projects

p
  | CAMotics project files keep track of the three main parts of the simulation:
ol
  li <a href='#nc-files'>Tool Paths</a> (NC files).
  li <a href='#tools'>Tool tables</a>.
  li <a href='#workpiece'>Workpiece</a> descriptions.

p
  | Project files are stored as
  | <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML'>XML</a>.
  | These files contain links to NC files, so they must be kept
  | together.

p
  | If you open NC files directly in CAMotics, i.e. with out a project file,
  | CAMotics will create a default workpiece and tool table automatically.
  | If you make changes you will want to save the .xml project file and open it,
  | instead of the NC file, in future runs.

h2#projects-file-operations New, Open, Close, Save & Save As

p
  | The main operations on project files are new, open, close, save, and save
  | as.  These operations can all be accessed through the File menu.

h2#projects-detecting-modifications Detecting Modifications
img(src='images/manual/modified.png')
p
  | CAMotics will automatically detect any changes to the project.
  | When it does this a '*' will appear in the window's title bar.
  | Any attempt to close the current project, either by exiting the program,
  | or creating or opening a new project will bring up a dialog which
  | will ask you to either save the current project, discard the changes
  | and proceed with the requested operation or cancel.

h2#projects-viewing-examples Viewing the Examples
p
  | The File menu contains a submenu of example projects which you can try
  | out to get a better feel for what CAMotics can do.

p
  | Projects may use imperial or metric units.  <a href='#tools-units'>Tools
  | units</a> may be configured independently.
