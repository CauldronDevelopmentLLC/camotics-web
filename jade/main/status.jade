  | Joseph Coffland of
  | <a href='http://cauldrondevelopment.com/'>Cauldron Development LLC</a>,
  | began development of CAMotics in
  | early 2011.  An alpha release of the software was
  | first made available to the public in April, 2012.
  | CAMotics has an active community of users and active
  | development continues in to 2014 (and hopefully
  | beyond!).  Although there are plans to do much more,
  | many of its users find CAMotics very useful in its
  | current state.  True to the nature of Open-Source
  | software, and unlike our commercial counterparts,
  | version number increases and claims of software
  | stability remain conservative.

h2#features Features
ul
  li Fast 3-axis cut-workpiece simulation with 3D visualization.
  li Simulates cylindrical, conical, ballnose, spheroid and snubnose tool
    | shapes.
  li Tool path 3D visualization.
  li Multi-threaded rendering can take advantage of multi-processor CPUs.
  li
    | <a href="gcode.html">GCode</a> parsing, simulation, verification and
    | annotation.
  li In application GCode and <a href="tplang.org">TPL</a> view and edit.
  li Supports LinuxCNC (AKA EMC2) O-codes.
  li Export cut workpiece to STL file.
  li Tool table editing.
  li Add height probing to 2D <a href="gcode.html">GCode</a> files.  Very
    | useful for circuit board cutting and metal engraving.
  li 2D <a href="gcode.html">GCode</a> path optimization. (in progress
    +issue(11)
    | )
  li Operates in Windows and Linux.
  li
    | Released under the
    | <a href='http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html'>GPL v2+ license</a>.

h2#limitations Limitations
ul
  li Simulates only snapshots of the cutting process. See issue
    +issue(2)
    | .
  li No 5-axis simulation.  See issue
    +issue(17)
    | .
  li No Lathe simulation.
  li No CAM facilities yet, e.g. 3D model to tool path conversion.
  li No CNC machine control, not a replacement for LinuxCNC or MACH3.
  li Does not yet detect over/under cutting, collisions with
    | the tool shaft or fixtures or rapid moves in the material.
  li Not all of the LinuxCNC <a href="gcode.html">GCode</a> language is
    | implemented, yet.


h2#future-plans Future Plans
p
  | Many features are planed for the future of CAMotics.  Much
  | of this depends on the availability of developer time and funding.
p Here are some of the current ideas:
  ul
    li Faster real-time cutting simulation.
    li Rotational 4th axis simulation.
    li 5-axis simulation.
    li Lathe simulation.
    li Tool collision detection.
    li Fixture collision detection.
    li Simulate cutting multiple sides of a workpiece.
    li Feed and speed calculator.
    li Machine description: speeds, dimensions, axes, etc.
    li CNC remote control.
    li Workpiece view slicing.
    li Multiple workpieces.
    li Composite tools.
    li 3D printer simulation.
    li CAM routines: pocketing, offsetting, arrays, etc.
    li Font V-Carving.
    li Tool path optimization.
