  | Being able to simulate is a critical part of creating
  | CNC tool paths. Programming a CNC with out a simulator
  | is cutting with out measuring; it's both dangerous and
  | expensive. With CAMotics you can preview the results of
  | your cutting operation before you fire up your
  | machine. This will save you time and money and open up a
  | world of creative possibilities by allowing you to
  | rapidly visualize and improve upon designs with out
  | wasting material or breaking tools.
